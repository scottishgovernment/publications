<h3>Scottish Government consultation process</h3>
<p>
    Consultation is an essential part of the policymaking process. It gives us the opportunity to consider your
    opinion and expertise on a proposed area of work.
</p>
<p>
    You can find all our consultations online: <a href="http://consult.gov.scot">http://consult.gov.scot</a>.
    Each consultation details the issues under consideration, as well as a way for you to give us your views,
    either online, by email or by post.
</p>
<p>
    Responses will be analysed and used as part of the decision making process, along with a range of other
    available information and evidence. We will publish a report of this analysis for every consultation.
    Depending on the nature of the consultation exercise the responses received may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>indicate the need for policy development or review</li>
    <li>inform the development of a particular policy</li>
    <li>help decisions to be made between alternative policy proposals</li>
    <li>be used to finalise legislation before it is implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>
    While details of particular circumstances described in a response to a consultation exercise may usefully inform
    the policy process, consultation exercises cannot address individual concerns and comments, which should be
    directed to the relevant public body.
