  <p>Tackling child poverty is a critical mission of the Scottish Government, cross-government work and stakeholder engagement is ongoing and the government's approach is informed by a wealth of evidence and <a href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/child-poverty-statistics/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">statistics on child poverty</a>. </p>
  <p>In the development of the original Child Poverty Pathfinders, a range of evidence was used. This included the report <em>Listening to the voices and views of children and young people: What's important for wellbeing and alleviating the impacts of poverty?</em> This came out of <a href="https://childrensneighbourhoods.scot/">Children's Neighbourhoods Scotland</a>, which was a place-based programme working to improve outcomes for all children and young people living in neighbourhoods with high levels of poverty.</p>
  <p>Evidence is continuously collected against a range of wellbeing indicators, which is helpful for understanding the impact of poverty on children - <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/children-young-people-families-outcomes-framework-core-wellbeing-indicators-national-reporting-children-families-analysis-september-2023/">Children, young people and families outcomes framework - core wellbeing indicators: analysis</a>.</p>
  <p>An <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/annex-6-evidence-review-works/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">evidence review on what works in tackling child poverty</a> sets out which approaches are most helpful. </p>
  <p>Data shows that children in priority families are more likely to be in poverty and the Scottish Government has compiled <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/tackling-child-poverty-priority-families-overview/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">evidence on each of the priority family groups</a>.</p>
  <p>As is set out in <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/children-young-people-families-outcomes-framework-core-wellbeing-indicators-national-reporting-children-families-analysis-september-2023/">Children, young people and families outcomes framework - core wellbeing indicators: analysis</a> children living in the 20% least deprived areas display substantially better outcomes than those in the 20% most deprived areas, and this pattern is consistent across all indicators relating to child development, attainment, mental health, and physical health.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/annex-6-evidence-review-works/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">evidence review on what works in tackling child poverty</a> highlights the need for a person-centred, holistic approach, within a framework of understanding structural barriers, in order to maximise the effectiveness of policies and avoid perpetuating stereotyping and stigma. Also, clear targeting strategies that identify and support priority families are crucial. </p>
  <p>Data shows that children in priority families are more likely to be in poverty. The Scottish Government has compiled <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/tackling-child-poverty-priority-families-overview/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">evidence on each of the priority family groups</a> which details the unique structural barriers they are likely to face and emphasises the need for services which address these barriers. </p>
